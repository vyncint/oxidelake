# The vendored termlens skill must name the version this workspace depends on.
#
# `.claude/skills/termlens/SKILL.md` is a copy of the file termlens ships for
# coding agents. It is refreshed by hand, and the failure mode is silent: the
# dependency gets bumped, the copy does not, and every agent working in this
# repository is then handed guidance for a version that is no longer here —
# wrong signatures, absent APIs, advice that was true one release ago. That
# is not hypothetical here: the copy sat at 0.9.0 while `docs/` still said
# 0.6, three releases behind the dependency.
#
# Nothing can diff it against upstream: the published crate does not ship the
# skill, so there is no registry copy to compare with. What *is* checkable is
# that the two versions agree, which is exactly the drift that happens.
#
# Compares major.minor only. A termlens patch release does not rewrite the
# skill, and demanding a re-copy for every one of them would make this noise.
#
# Usage: check-skill-version.sh [SKILL.md] [Cargo.toml]
